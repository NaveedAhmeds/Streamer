# Streamer 🎧

A simple, static website to browse artists, check out their songs, and visit their socials. Built back in my 2nd semester while grinding through HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

---

## What’s inside?

- Browse a curated list of artists  
- Check out their songs with ease  
- Links to socials so you can stalk ’em legally  
- Clean, minimal UI — no fancy frameworks, just pure front-end vibes

---

## Why?

Because sometimes you gotta build stuff the old-fashioned way — no backend, no servers, just HTML/CSS/JS and a whole lotta enthusiasm.

---

## How to use

1. Clone the repo or just open `index.html` in your browser  
2. Browse the artists  
3. Click through to their songs or socials  
4. Enjoy the throwback simplicity

## Tech stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (vanilla, baby!)

## Future plans?

Honestly? None planned — this one’s a nostalgic snapshot of my early coding days. But hey, pull requests and ideas are welcome!
